# Lpbox-ADMM

This project includes: 1) the codes of the Lp-Box ADMM algorithm, and 2) the demos to reproduce the results reported in our [TPAMI manuscript](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8378001/). 

ANY integer programming problem can be naturally abd efficiently solved by the Lp-Box ADMM algorithm, 
as it only equivalently replaces the integer constraint space, while being independent of the objective function.

If you adopt the Lp-Box ADMM algorithm in your project, please cite as follows.
